# PRODIGY_DS_TASK_2 - Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.
I have successfully completed Task-02 of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech!
During this project, I meticulously cleaned and analyzed the Titanic dataset using Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
